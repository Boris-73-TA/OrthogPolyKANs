# OrthogPolyKANs
Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) using orthogonal polynomials instead of B-splines.
- ! Based heavily on ChebyKAN implementation by SynodicMonth !
- There are many orthogonal polynomials: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_orthogonal_polynomials
  - https://mathworld.wolfram.com/OrthogonalPolynomials.html
- Polynomials: Legendre, Chebyshev 2nd kind, Gegenbauer, Hermite, and Jacobi
- Working on Bessel, Romanovski, and Fibonacci/Lucas Polynomials...
- Future Work (?): P-splines, box splines, and M-splines instead of B-splines
