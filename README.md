Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) using orthogonal polynomials instead of B-splines.
! Based heavily on ChebyKAN implementation by SynodicMonth !
- There are many orthogonal polynomials: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_orthogonal_polynomials
- Polynomials: Legendre, Chebyshev 2nd kind, Gegenbauer, Hermite, and Jacobi
- Working on Bessel and Fibonacci/Lucas Polynomials...
